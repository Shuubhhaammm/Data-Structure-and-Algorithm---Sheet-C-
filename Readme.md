# Data Structure and Algorithm:

## Data Structure-
  **Data-** Raw data or unorganised fact which do not have meaning.
  **Structure-** Refers to the arrangement or organization of different parts to form a whole. 

_Data Structure_ is a way of organizing and storing data to perfoem operations efficiently. It defines the relationship between the data and the operations that can be performed on that data.

* Example of Data Structure-
    * Array
    * Stack
    * Queue
    * LinkedList
    * Tree 
    * Graph
    * Hash
    * Tries
    * Heaps

## Types of Data Structure-

1. Primitive Data Structure: A Primitive Data Structure is a basic and fundamental type of data structure that is directly operated upon by the programming language.

  **Types-**
    * Integer - Represent Whole numbers(e.g., -1,0,3,2,..)
       * Example: int, long, short
    * Floating-point - Represent decimal numbers (e.g., 44.22, -2.5)
       * Example: float, double
    * Character - Repersent single character (e.g., 'A', '1')
       * Example: char
    * Boolean - Represent true or false values.
       * Exmaple: boolean
    * Void - Represent the absence of a type. It is often used for functions that do not return a value. 

2. Non-Primitive Data Structure: It is a more complex structure constructed using primitive data types or other non-primitive types.
These structure can hold and organize a collection of data elements in different ways.

  **Types-**
   * Linear-
